##*Rungis Market*

#**DESCRIPTION OF THE APPLICATION**
We created a simulation of goods consumption. The Rungis market opens every morning at 5am and closes at 2pm. 
The restaurants welcome each hungry client. When they are empty of food, they have to go refuel in the Rungis market to fill 
their stocks. Each time a meal is cooked, the restaurant's stock is decremented by one for each ingredient which form
this recipe. The client has a resistance time. If the cooktime exceeds the resistance time of the client, he will then leave.
Each restaurant has its own opening and closing hours.
